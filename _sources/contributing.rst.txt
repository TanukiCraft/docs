============

Guide on how to contribute + available sphinx extensions as well as 
available/often used controls such as notes, warnings, etc. comming soon.

Basic information
-----------------
.. important::
    We are using `Furo <https://github.com/pradyunsg/furo>`_ as theme for this documentation.
    See the `Furo Markup reference <https://pradyunsg.me/furo/reference/>`_ for information on 

Visual Studio Code in addition to the reStructuredText and reStructuredText Syntax
extensions provide an easier experience while editing RST files.

.. tip:: 
    You will see a pen icon at the top right of every page next to the theme toggle button
    that will take you to the source file on GitHub to edit it.



Report an issue
---------------
If you noticed outdated/missing content or want to add something
